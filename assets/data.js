Slogan: ‘Read and Grow.’ Renamed Kerala Grandhasala Sangham after states reorganisation in 1956, it grows — panchayat by panchayat — into a 6,000-library network: the densest village-library system in India and the infrastructure underneath Kerala's literacy outcomes for the next 80 years." },
  { year: "1947–49", title: "Partition shatters the libraries", body: "Delhi's Urdu collections are split, looted, or burned. Scholars die or flee. The Maulana Hifzur Rahman Seoharvi tries to save the Madrasa Aminia library; much of it is lost. Partition was also a knowledge-destruction event." },
  { year: "1948", title: "Tamil Nadu Library Act — India's first", body: "Drafted with Ranganathan's input, but restricts membership to paying users — contradicting his own First Law on the day of its passage." },
  { year: "1956", title: "Ambedkar dies, leaving 50,000 books at Rajgruha", body: "Babasaheb's personal library at his Mumbai home is the largest in 1950s India. The country that wouldn't let him into a public library left him no choice but to build his own." },
  { year: "1962", title: "KSSP — science for social revolution", body: "Kerala Sasthra Sahithya Parishad inaugurated at Devagiri College, Kozhikode, on 10 September 1962 by a group of 40 science writers and teachers. ‘Science for Social Revolution.’ Reading circles, science publishing in Malayalam, library campaigns, total-literacy organising. Wins the Right Livelihood Award in 1996. Proof that mass literacy in India has been led by movements, not ministries." },
  { year: "1967", title: "DMK comes to power — and reading rooms become governance", body: "Annadurai becomes Chief Minister of Madras State. Through the 1950s and 60s the Dravidian movement had built padippakams — reading rooms attached to DMK branch offices, stocked with Periyar-Anna-Karunanidhi pamphlets and run as night schools for non-literate adults. After 1967, this movement infrastructure is folded into the State; in 1972, the DMK government establishes a dedicated Directorate of Public Libraries — the only Indian state where reading rooms moved from movement to ministry at scale." },
  { year: "1986", title: "Chattopadhyay Committee — drafted, then shelved", body: "A government-appointed committee declares what should have been obvious: public libraries must be free, and the State must fund them. The Union Government receives the report. The recommendations sit on a shelf — the same shelf the books are not on." },
  { year: "1989", title: "Haryana defines its public libraries as actually free", body: "Three years after Chattopadhyay, Haryana passes the Public Libraries Act, 1989 (Haryana No. 20 of 1989). Section 2(e) defines a public library as ‘a library, which permits members of the public to use it for reference or borrowing without charging fee or subscription.’ To date, the only Indian state Act whose legal definition of ‘public library’ excludes fees. Two years before liberalisation slams the door on this kind of public-good legislation." },
  { year: "1991", title: "Liberalisation: the State retreats from social services", body: "Manmohan Singh's structural-adjustment reforms unbundle subsidies, open to foreign investment, and reframe public spending as inefficient. The Chattopadhyay Committee's call for a publicly-funded national library system — made five years earlier — becomes politically unaffordable in a single budget cycle. Privatisation, not provision, is the new common sense." },
  { year: "1993", title: "The Centre 'considers' a library policy. Decides to do nothing", body: "An internal review revisits the 1986 Chattopadhyay recommendations. It acknowledges them, then concludes that fiscal space is unavailable. The draft is shelved a second time. The library question goes silent at the Centre for over a decade." },
  { year: "1996", title: "Kerala's People's Plan — power, and money, to the panchayat", body: "On 25 August 1996, the LDF government under E.K. Nayanar launches Janakeeya Aasoothranam, with EMS Namboodiripad as architect. 35% of state development funds devolved to panchayats; gram sabhas decide local priorities. The State that already has the densest village-library network in India (built by KLA volunteers since 1945) hands its panchayats real budgets. Decentralisation does what national policy refused to do: makes a public library a local government's job, not a Centre's promise." },
  { year: "2007", title: "National Knowledge Commission · Libraries as 'knowledge economy' infrastructure", body: "Sam Pitroda's NKC, commissioned by Manmohan Singh in 2005, releases 'Libraries: Gateways to Knowledge.' The framing has shifted: libraries are now digital infrastructure for the 'knowledge society,' not constitutional public institutions. The report recommends a small, technology-led National Mission on Libraries. The anti-caste, free-access argument from Phule, Ambedkar, and Chattopadhyay does not appear." },
  { year: "2014", title: "National Mission on Libraries — too small to matter", body: "Seven years after NKC, NML launches. ₹78.7 crore sanctioned in total to modernise 64 libraries — in a country of 1.4 billion. Roughly the price of one South Mumbai apartment. ₹20.6 crore of that remains undisbursed. NML is not a policy. It is a press release." },
  { year: "2016", title: "The categorisation that buried the Mission", body: "A Cabinet decision on 3 August 2016 sorts centrally-sponsored schemes into Core (states must fund) and Optional (states may, if they like). The National Mission on Libraries fits none of the ten Core priority sectors — the Ministry of Culture had no seat on the sub-group — so it falls, by residual, into the Optional bucket no one is obliged to fund. The de-prioritisation of public libraries was not debated. It was a filing decision. (Cabinet ratification, PIB; NITI Aayog Sub-Group report, Oct 2015.)" },
  { year: "2017", title: "China enacts a Public Library Law", body: "A comparably-sized country enshrines public libraries as a statutory right. India still has no equivalent — the draft has been pending since the 1986 Chattopadhyay Committee." },
  { year: "2019–20", title: "One website launched, the Mission declared 'complete'", body: "The Indian Culture Portal — one of the four components of the National Mission on Libraries — goes live in December 2019. Three months later, in March 2020, the Ministry tells the Rajya Sabha the Mission 'is complete now' and is not extended. The other three components — the Centre-State matching scheme that would have built physical libraries, the survey, the capacity-building — are treated as finished by being abandoned. That year the library-development budget collapses to ₹0.73 crore against ₹118.51 crore allocated: not unallocated — unspent. (RS Q.277, 12.03.2020; RS Q.310, Feb 2022; Union Budget RE 2019-20.)" },
  { year: "2020", title: "National Education Policy 2020 — libraries reduced to 'digital'", body: "The first major education policy in 35 years. Library mentions are overwhelmingly about digital access and digitisation — 'one nation, one digital library' replaces the question of physical public libraries entirely. The library as anti-caste infrastructure, as a constitutional public good, as a place where caste, gender, and class meet on neutral ground — gets no chapter, no allocation, no target." },
  { year: "2024", title: "FLN publishes the People's National Library Policy", body: "The Free Libraries Network drafts and publishes PNLP24 — the document the State has refused to write for seventy-five years." },
  { year: "2024–25", title: "The Digital Shift — ₹5,000 crore for 'Digital Libraries'", body: "In the 2023–24 budget, the Centre earmarks a ₹5,000 crore corpus for states to build digital libraries at the Panchayat level. The physical public library remains un-funded. The State chooses the screen over the shelf — a shift that bypasses the millions without reliable electricity or devices." },
  { year: "2026", title: "You read this", body: "What happens next is up to people who have a bookshelf at home and a friend who is a Member of Parliament." }
